// There are n heaps of sticks and two players who move alternately. On each move, a player chooses a non-empty heap and removes 1, 2, or 3 sticks. The player who removes the last stick wins the game.
// Your task is to find out who wins if both players play optimally.

// Input:

// The first input line contains an integer t: the number of tests. After this, t test cases are described:
// The first line contains an integer n: the number of heaps.
// The next line has n integers x1,x2,â€¦,xn: the number of sticks in each heap.

// Output:
// For each test case, print "first" if the first player wins the game and "second" if the second player wins the game.
